              I started learning networking on level 2 and the Unit was great, I
              got introduced to cisco packet tracer which is great software for
              simulating networks, I started out by building 3 basic networks as
              well of building my own networks in my spare time. I remember
              building 3 networks, home, buisness and enterprise, these were
              different levels of complexity
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              One was a basic home network with a couple of connected devices,
              the second network included a few servers and more computers which
              are connected to different switches and the other network being
              the Enterprize level network, included a W.A.N which connects the
              main network to sub networks.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              I moved onto bigger things after learning this using Packet Tracer
              such as making my first real-world network in my house using Unifi
              networks, this was a great experience for me to learn about
              building real-world networks and how they work, I now want to get
              into a networking job and bring all my skills that I have learned,
              to the table.

            <h2>What got me interested in networking?</h2>
            <p>
              When I got introduced into networking, I was studing btec level 2
              and the unit specifically was very interesting as I got to take a
              deeper dive into how all of our devices communicate on the
              network. Learning networking for the first few months was very
              fulfilling and I enjoyed learning about it. I don't know if it was
              the fact that networking powers the world or that the technolegy
              is just so interesting, something about networking got me thinking
              "This is my world". Ever since I've got introduced to it, I've
              loved doing it and especially using labs to learn and improve my
              skills in the field.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              I plan on doing my CCNA (Cisco Certified Network Associate) exam
              in the future and improving my skills in this area of IT.
